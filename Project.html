                    <h4>Database Filtering Prgram</h4>
                    <p>Designed a custom application in the Python programming language that filters a large data set and inserts the filtered data into an SQLite database. The target dataset is a collection of 1,000 data entries. Each entry has information about a single meteorite landing on Earth and consists of the following twelve data fields: Name, Id, name type, reclass, mass (g), fall, year, reclat, reclong, Geolocation, States, Countries. The data used in this program is gathered from a NASA data repository using HTTP GET requests. This program builds a SQLite database with seven tables, with each table corresponding to a continental region on Earth. The purpose of this program is to determine which meteorites fell in regions on earth based on the geolocation given for each meteorite in the NASA data.
        (With each of the continental regions having a bounding box associated with it. Ie North, America, South America, Africa …etc.</p>

            <h5>Web Scraper Database Program</h5>           
                <p>Made a custom application, a scraper that can be used on different types of media applications on this project this program scrapes Amazon data. This program gathers product data within the following six product categories: Over Ear Headphones, USB Microphones, 1080p Webcams, Capture Cards, 8- channel Audio Mixers, and Gaming Laptops. This program was designed on the idea that you are being hired by a consumer electronics retailer that would like to research popular product trends. This program collects and filters Amazon’s product data using the Python programming language. The goal is to gather updated data from Amazon product listings, this program then filters the data and presents the filtered results to be used and shown to non-technical users. Using a SQLite database for storage this program scrapes,
        and extracts the product data for the listings listed above and extracts that data to be put into a database for filtering.</p>

                <h6>Final Group Project Idea</h6>
                <p>Possibly a vendor type website or database type website that
                     catalogs data based on DCU characters or yugioh cards</p>
